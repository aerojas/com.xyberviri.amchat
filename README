AM Chat offers an exciting low tech take on "chat frequencies", instead of "General" players can use frequencies to transmit there conversations.
Just like a radio that frequency can be change, you can also encode that chat so only players with that same code on the same frequency can read your text.
Local Chat can also be restricted, by default this is set to 64 blocks. A filter can be set so only legible text can be received.
You can optionally limit the distance of radio chat as well.

Features:
..turn personal radio on/off
..tune to a frequency between 32-512 rHz
..use a code between 1-999, to encrypt your chat, 0 to disables
..turn mic on/off
..filter chat that is encrypted and otherwise unreadable.
..set a frequency cutoff so you receive chat from <your_frequency>+-<cutoff>
..set a frequency default freq. to set when joining server 32 by default
..set if a player's radio is default set to on upon joining server
